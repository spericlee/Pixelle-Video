## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PixelleLab/Pixelle-Video.git
cd Pixelle-Video
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

!!! tip "Recommended: Use uv"
    This project uses `uv` as the package manager, which is faster and more reliable than traditional pip.

#### Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install project dependencies (uv will create a virtual environment automatically)
uv sync
```

#### Using pip

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

---

## Verify Installation

Run the following command to verify the installation:

```bash
# Using uv
uv run streamlit run web/app.py

# Or using pip (activate virtual environment first)
streamlit run web/app.py
```

Your browser should automatically open `http://localhost:8501` and display the Pixelle-Video web interface.

!!! success "Installation Successful!"
    If you can see the web interface, the installation was successful! Next, check out the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) to set up your services.

## Optional: Install ComfyUI (Local Deployment)

If you want to run image generation locally, you'll need to install ComfyUI:

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone ComfyUI
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start ComfyUI

```bash
python main.py
```

ComfyUI runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8188` by default.

!!! info "ComfyUI Models"
    ComfyUI requires downloading model files to work. Please refer to the [ComfyUI documentation](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) for information on downloading and configuring models.
